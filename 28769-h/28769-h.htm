<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>TED DECIDES TO ACCEPT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Ted, oh Ted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker&#8217;s hail was not altogether
unexpected. The boy called Ted turned
about and met Captain Wilson half way.</p>
<p>The familiar figure of the boy proves to
be Ted Marsh who had come out to Western
Canada with his friends, John Dean and
Mrs. Dean. After a number of months on
the Double X Ranch, months which the
boy had found both exhilarating and tremendously
to his liking, he had been sent
to Wayland Academy. To those of us who
have read Ted Marsh the Boy Scout, the
following facts are familiar. A brief resume,
however, is set forth herewith for
those readers who are new so that they can
safely gather the threads of our story.</p>
<p>Ted Marsh, a likeable newsboy, living in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Chicago, makes the acquaintance of John
Dean, a Canadian rancher. Ted takes him
to the Settlement to which he belongs.
Dean&#8217;s interest in the boy grows. Then as
the boy begins to show the man the Chicago
that he knows, there is the startling
clamor of fire engines and all the evidence
of a nearby fire. It is in the tenement in
which Ted lives. The boy cannot be held
back. He rushes into the building to try
to save his mother. Fortunately, his mother
has already left the burning building. The
boy is caught within and only makes his
escape by jumping from the window on high
into the firemen&#8217;s waiting net below.</p>
<p>After a stay in the hospital John Dean
and his wife take the boy West with the consent
of his mother who unselfishly lets him
go because opportunity, so she feels, is there.
Ted&#8217;s father had left home just before Ted
was born.</p>

CAUTIOUSLY HE PROWLED ABOUT<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Strong interest centers around the doings
of Ted and his new-found friends both
at the ranch and at the academy. Adventures
are many. The boy is found to be
cool in emergencies. He has qualities which
bring respect and liking. The end of the
story finds him suggested for an important
mission to Chicago&mdash;and his youth is considered
of great advantage by the gentlemen
who wish to send him. The opening of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
the present story finds Captain Wilson hailing
Ted, ready to broach the subject and find
out if the boy is willing or unwilling to undertake
the mission:</p>
<p>The boy saluted. He stood at attention
while the captain studied him for a few
moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted, boy, I come to you on very important
business. Not as Scout to Scout,
but as man to man. For you can safely refuse
to do this&mdash;it will not count against
you as Scout. Did Mr. Dean see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; the boy replied. &#8220;He told me
that in all probability you would wish to
see me in reference to an important matter.
And he told me that when you did ask me,
I was to be sure to decide with no other
thought than that of either wanting or not
wanting to do it. He doesn&#8217;t want my
friendship for him or for anyone else to influence
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly it, Ted. What we are
going to ask you to do, you must, first, want
to do, second, feel that you can do, third, be
sure it is in line with any convictions you
may have. Now, I suppose you are even
more anxious to know what it is all about?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy nodded his assent but waited for
the other to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever we are going to tell you or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
which you may gather you do under pledge
of secrecy. And now let us go to meet
Major Church. While we are on our way,
bear with me for a few minutes while I go
into all this for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Germany, we all feel, is getting ready
to make war. Most people cannot realize it,
but we have fairly good proof gathered both
in London and in Ottawa that it is so. We
also know that over in the States a big army
of so-called German Americans but who are
Germans in reality, men who have never
severed their allegiance to the Fatherland,
are getting ready, preparing to invade
Canada. They are also to have the help of
many Irishmen who hate England.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason for this conference is to get
Canada to also prepare. The Germans are
working quietly, secretly. We cannot get
the evidence to show what they are doing
although we have tried. Here in Canada,
they simply will not believe, and cite the
fact that Germany has repeatedly declared
its friendship as the best kind of proof of
our being all wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is all this too complex for you, my boy?&#8221;
Captain Wilson interrupted his discourse
with the sudden thought that he was not
making it clear to his listener.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you, Captain Wilson,&#8221; the
boy answered. So the captain continued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We think we have found out one source
through which we can get information. We
must, however, proceed with great caution.
Nothing would please the Germans more
than to show us up and give surface proof
of their good will and good intentions. Incidently,
they would give a lot to make those
of us who are watching, the laughing stock
of Canada and the United States. That is
why we must be very careful. We must
try to get Washington to see the truth not
through any suspicion they may have but by
actual, obvious, undeniable evidence. If we
can furnish such proof the Government at
Washington will find good reason for watching
these German-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for us to get the proof. Once we
get that we will not have to worry as to
trouble from the other side of the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; the captain concluded as
they entered the building and made their
way to the room in which Major Church
was waiting, &#8220;you know who some of the
men at this conference are. Besides Mr.
Dean and myself, Major Smith, our chief,
is an ex-army officer. Colonel Graham is
Syd Graham&#8217;s father. Mr. Smythe comes
from Toronto; he is in the employ of the
Government. Well, here we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered a small room. Major Church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
put aside some papers on which he had been
engaged.</p>
<p>Captain Wilson introduced Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of you, young man,&#8221; was
the major&#8217;s greeting. &#8220;You are a credit to
the school, I find. And we have called you
before us because of qualities we find you
possess.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much you do know,
lad, but war with Germany is near. Germans
masquerading as German-Americans
are planning an attempt against Canada
and they intend to carry out that attempt
just before the immediate declaration of
war. We believe that the meetings of the
prime movers are held in Milwaukee, possibly
in Chicago. It is important for us to
know their plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We perhaps could decide on anyone of
several men but it occurred to us that to
send one so young as you are would in itself
lull any suspicions they may have. They
will not connect you with our work, which
is in itself half the battle. But, of course, it
would not do to send any one who, though
young, is not also endowed with a fair
amount of good common sense and discretion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted listened. Nothing that the Major
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
said escaped him. He realized the weight
of the speaker&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you have lived in Chicago.
That is correct, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; Ted replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it will help in case the point to
cover is Chicago. With your knowledge of
Chicago very little time would be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the main,&#8221; the Major continued, &#8220;it
is mostly a question of being alert&mdash;eyes,
ears and mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Wilson,&#8221; the Major turned. &#8220;Is
Mr. Smythe obtaining the necessary information,
do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we will soon know,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;who is the operative in that district and
whether Chicago or Milwaukee is the point
to cover. Mr. Smythe is waiting for the
answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major Church gave Ted an account of
how their secret service men worked and
how information was obtained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the fact that we have all these
men, I feel sure that you will be able to get
the information we desire more readily than
any of our men. In a way, you will be a
temporary secret service man.&#8221;</p>
<p>He carefully outlined his reasons for believing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
that Ted might be successful in getting
information.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, Canada is not your country.
There is no call for you to do it. You may
wish to remain neutral and we do not want
you to go unless you wish to, heart and
soul. But should you go, successful or unsuccessful,
you will be rendering us a great
service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go,&#8221; Ted answered very quietly.
&#8220;Canada is second only to my loyalty
for my own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major Church and Captain Wilson gave
Ted a hand-clasp which showed their feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are true blue, my lad,&#8221; said Major
Church. &#8220;We will have information as to
location from Mr. Smythe very soon. You
can understand the need of secrecy when
our wires are coded. By the way, Wilson,&#8221;
he turned to the captain, &#8220;you have an instructor
in German here, have you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better watch him a bit. My theory is
that all of these Germans will bear watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three hours later Captain Wilson and Ted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
joined Mr. Smythe, Mr. Dean, Colonel Graham
and Major Church. Mr. Smythe presented
the following wire:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Smythe,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5625em;'>&#8220;Wayland.</span><br />
&#8220;Ekal stroper On. 2 ecalp Ees H.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;As you know, gentlemen, they have used
the simplest code because the information
would only be information for us. It is the
reversal of the letters of a word. Let us
see:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Lake Reports No. 2 place. See H.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;H is Strong. No. 2 is Chicago. Strong
is our chief operative there. Ted will have
to see him to get his information and also
such help as he may need. But one thing
we know&mdash;their headquarters just now are
at Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of it,&#8221; said Ted. &#8220;Since Chicago
is my home town, I can do things there
and may be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said John Dean, &#8220;you start
tomorrow, Ted. You see, speed is the thing.
That will give you a chance to see your
mother and sister, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I need hardly say,&#8221; said the major,
&#8220;that even your mother had best not know
about this, unless it should be actually
necessary. Secrecy is imperative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, sir,&#8221; Ted replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing more,&#8221; Major Church added,
and he spoke to the men in the room. &#8220;No
matter who asks about Ted, he has gone
home to see his mother; someone is not well,
let us say. The slightest hint or suspicion
as to the purpose of his trip would frustrate
it. Will you, Mr. Smythe, telegraph to Toronto,
and tell the chief just what has been
done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Smythe nodded his head.</p>
<p>Ted went out first. As he closed the door,
another door far down the hall opened, a
head came out, a very German head&mdash;the
head of Mr. Pfeffer, instructor in that language.
Quietly and quickly it was withdrawn.
Ted did not observe this; if he had,
it probably would not have had any meaning
for him. Mr. Pfeffer was a very curious
gentleman, he would have given much to
know the purpose of the meeting; even now,
he was debating with himself whether he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
should do some innocent questioning of Ted.
He decided against it.</p>
<p>Just before retiring, Captain Wilson
came into Ted&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems silly to distrust Pfeffer, Lucky,
still when you get to a station, say Winnipeg,
I would telegraph your mother that you
are coming. If any questions should be
asked of her, she should say that she knows
you are coming. See? It is best to be safe
and to guard against everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early morn saw Ted on the train. It was
announced to those who made inquiries that
Ted had been called home. Mr. Pfeffer received
the information with private wonder
and doubt.</p>
<p>He took occasion to stroll down to the
telegraph office later that same day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Peter,&#8221; he said to the operator.</p>
<p>Peter turned around to see if anyone was
about, then brought out a copy of the coded
telegram.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy code, professor&mdash;what does it
mean?&#8221; His copy already had translated
the words properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may mean nothing or it may mean
everything. The boy is going to Chicago&mdash;perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Chicago is No. 2&mdash;perhaps not.
Peter, you had better send a telegram. Better
be sure, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would they be sending a child and
for what?&#8221; Peter was incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the boy send a telegram?&#8221; Mr. Pfeffer
asked. &#8220;I had better see them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was none that had been sent
that morning to Chicago.</p>
<p>A long wire, also in code, went forward
from Mr. Pfeffer to Chicago. Then that
worthy strolled back to the Academy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>PLANS ARE MADE TO MEET TED</h3>
</div>
<p>In a room in one of the West Side streets
of Chicago, in an old-fashioned office
building, which also rented rooms to lodges
and societies, eight men were engaged in
earnest conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wrong, O&#8217;Reilly,&#8221; said one of
them. &#8220;England will not dare come into it.
There are men in England who would want
the country to war against my land. But
the powers that be, and the people, too, will
be against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate England, Berman,&#8221; said O&#8217;Reilly.
&#8220;There are Irishmen who are willing to lick
the hand that has beaten them and has held
them in subjection, but they are not true
sons of Erin. I am against England, but I
do not despise the English as you Germans
do. Once they are aroused, mark my words,
slow as they may be at the start, they will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
be a mighty force.&#8221; His eyes flashed.
&#8220;Many people call me a traitor, but Ireland,
not England, is my country, and all
Irishmen should be against the country that
holds it slave.</p>
<p>&#8220;But to business, gentlemen. Will you,
Mr. Schmidt, explain the call for this meeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will,&#8221; answered he who had been
addressed. &#8220;There are two things for us
to take up&mdash;the less important first. I have
a telegram from our good friend Pfeffer up
in Wayland, in Alberta, Canada, where he is
doing our work, but is presumably a German
instructor. Ah, here it is&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out the coded wire that Pfeffer
had sent. &#8220;I have figured out the code and
it reads as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ference eld erecon urday h atch h oysat
ed w arsh b adian t cific M eftcan erepa en l

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Conference held here Saturday. Watch
boy Ted Marsh, Canadian Pacific, left here
seven A. M. Sunday. Called home by mother.
Suspect he is on way to see Strong.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Perhaps he has papers, may seek information.
Watch.&#8217;&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a></p>
<p>There was a discussion as to the telegram.
&#8220;Who is Strong?&#8221; asked O&#8217;Reilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the chief operative&mdash;secret service
man&mdash;stationed in Chicago by the Government
at Ottawa. We have him watched.
We have even instructions out that if he
becomes dangerous he will disappear very
suddenly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is bad business,&#8221; said a little man
named Heinrich.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad business nothing!&#8221; answered
Schmidt. &#8220;No one must stand in the forward
way. Germany first, last, forever.
What is Strong, what are you, what am I&mdash;poof,
nothing! But Germany&mdash;ah&mdash;&#8221; the
speaker&#8217;s eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will give those who are suspicious
ground for proof that their suspicions are
more than suspicions,&#8221; answered Heinrich.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let us not wander from the point, gentlemen,&#8221;
another man interrupted. &#8220;As I
gather from the telegram, this boy may be
coming to see Strong. Now, we must first
make sure of that fact, then find out what
it is he is coming for and stop him in his attempt,
if it concerns us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Reilly,&#8221; asked Mr. Winckel, a man
with spectacles which carried thick lenses,
&#8220;can you or one of your friends, perhaps,
meet the boy and pose as this man Strong?
Schmidt, you or Feldman had better go to
Milwaukee and try to place the boy and get
such information as you can. But do not
let him suspect you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Schmidt.</p>
<p>&#8220;When is he due?&#8221; asked Mr. Winckel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I should think it would be some
time tonight,&#8221; answered Schmidt. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look
and make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find out his home address,&#8221; added
Winckel. &#8220;Telegraph it to us and one of us
will hurry up and find out if his mother
really expects him. How about your part,
O&#8217;Reilly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to it,&#8221; answered the Irishman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is finished now. Oh, yes, one more
thing, Schmidt, better have Strong watched
even more closely. What is the other business?&#8221;
It could be seen that Mr. Winckel
was the moving spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, eight o&#8217;clock, here&mdash;the chief
will come from Washington. When Captain
Knabe comes, he will tell us just when the
day will be. It is very soon, very soon; the
long wait is over. Then, too, he will tell us
what we shall do. You will all be here?
Now we shall go to our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>They broke up. They were very thorough,
each man had his work assigned and
would see it carried through.</p>
<p>We shall turn to John Strong, who early
that morning had been slipped a memorandum
in code by the waitress serving breakfast
to him, announcing that Ted was to
come and to meet him. Also, Ted&#8217;s home
address.</p>
<p>John Strong was a clean-cut Canadian, hair
graying at the temples. No one knew better
than he how carefully he was watched. That
he was able to be as useful to his government
as he was, showed his ability.</p>
<p>He decided at once that he would not meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Ted. That would show one thing&mdash;the important
thing to those who would want to
know. How could he get to the boy&#8217;s mother
without being observed?</p>
<p>To the girl who waited on him he whispered
that he wanted her to arrange for two
cars to wait at the main entrance of the
Hotel La Salle at ten o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>He strolled out and immediately felt himself
shadowed. He reached the hotel,
looked at the register very carefully, as if
there was something there he wanted to see,
then turned to the cigar-stand. Turning
around, he saw another man looking just as
carefully at that register. He smiled. Now
he knew one of those who were watching
him. He pulled out some memorandum slips
from his pocket and made some notations.
As if by accident he left one of the slips on
the case, lighted his cigar, bought a newspaper,
and sat down and lounged.</p>
<p>Another man came to the cigar counter,
also bought some cigars, picked up some
matches, and with it the slip of paper.</p>
<p>So there were two.</p>
<p>At five minutes past the hour Strong
strolled to the door, made a frantic dash for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
the machine, which seemed very slow to
start. A moment later two men entered the
machine immediately next, gave the driver
instructions to follow the first machine,
which by now had dashed off.</p>
<p>The first car went south. You may remember
that Mrs. Marsh lived north. The
second car followed. The occupants could
never suspect the innocent appearing chauffeur
of that second car, as he swore and
raved at the policeman who had ordered him
to stop to let the east and west traffic go by
at the side street. The frantic men inside
were assured that he would make up the lost
time; that he knew the number of the car
he was following. But he never found that
car. He became very stupid, although always
pleasant.</p>
<p>John Strong reached the home of Mrs.
Marsh, certain that he had eluded the pursuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Marsh, I believe?&#8221; he asked as she
opened the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mrs. Marsh,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a friend of some friends of Ted.
The main reason for his coming down to
Chicago is to see me, although I am sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
he will think that seeing you will count for
even more than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get word from him?&#8221; further
asked Strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I got a telegram. It said he was
coming to see you, but that I was to let anyone
else who might ask think that he was
coming because I sent for him. I do not
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very carefully Strong explained it all to
Mrs. Marsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that these people should
not suspect that he is coming to see me,
only that he is coming home, nothing more.
It may even be, that one of them will be
here to see you, some time today. They
surely will if they find out anything about
his coming, and where you live. I will say
this, that I feel I am speaking for Mr. Dean
when I say it will be a great service to him
and to his country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to do anything for Mr.
Dean. You can count on me. I think I
understand and perhaps will be able to help.
Perhaps, too, my daughter, Helen, even
more so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you have your daughter come and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
see me right after supper. The train comes
in at 9:10 tonight, and she will meet you
afterward at the station. She will go there
from my office. Possibly, as you say, she
can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left Mrs. Marsh, confident that she
understood and that she had the ability and
willingness to carry her part through.</p>

Readers will find it interesting to study out the simplicity
of this code. There is special pleasure in their
working it out for themselves. It is simple and unweaves
itself once you have the key. For those who do not wish
to decipher the code, they can use the following method.
The first syllable of any word of more than one syllable
is attached to the third word following. Of one syllable
words the first letter is found by itself after the second
word. In no case is a single letter considered a word.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>TED ARRIVES IN CHICAGO</h3>
</div>
<p>Between the hours of seven and nine
that night many things were happening.
Helen had gone down to see Strong.
A man, who may have been a Dane or a
German, boarded Ted&#8217;s train at Milwaukee,
and O&#8217;Reilly was preparing to meet that
same train, as was John Strong. At home
Mrs. Marsh was leaving to meet the train.
We shall follow the man who boarded the
train. He entered one of the Pullmans, but
no boy seemed to be there; another one, and
there were two boys, but both seemed to be
with parents.</p>
<p>But he was successful in the third car. It
was Ted he saw and as he sat down very
near him he pulled out a Danish newspaper
and started to read.</p>
<p>Pretty soon he looked up. He seemed a
very pleasant man. He spoke to a man in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the seat in front of him, then he turned to
Ted. &#8220;Have you come from far?&#8221; he asked
innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Ted, &#8220;from Wayland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; observed the man. &#8220;Do you live in
Chicago or in Wayland?&#8221; He added, &#8220;I
live in Milwaukee, but I go twice, sometimes
three times a month to Chicago. My daughter
lives there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Chicago,&#8221; answered Ted. Truth to
tell, he was very glad to talk, the trip had
been a long one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you live, what part?&#8221; asked
his new acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over north, 11416 Wells street.&#8221; Ted
saw no reason why he should not tell this
harmless stranger where he lived. Although
he had no suspicion of him, he had made up
his mind that such questions he would answer,
no matter who asked them.</p>
<p>For he realized that the one way to arouse
curiosity was to appear secretive.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter lives up that way, too,&#8221;
the man said. He seemed quite interested
in the idea of making conversation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will leave you for a minute.&#8221; The
train was slowing up for Racine. His telegram
was all ready except for the address.
He rushed into the ticket office, added the
address and had it sent collect, and had
plenty of time to board the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why,&#8221; thought Ted, &#8220;he should
have to run into that station.&#8221; Ted&#8217;s suspicions
were somewhat aroused. He decided
to appear as if he had not taken note of the
actions of his acquaintance.</p>
<p>Schmidt had underestimated the ability
of the boy. He was so young, he thought,
there was no necessity for special care.</p>
<p>Then, too, he was so very affable, so very
simple. To his questions as to who would
meet him Ted answered that he thought no
one would, the time he was coming was a
little uncertain, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is to meet me, either. Perhaps
we can both go up home together, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied the boy, &#8220;that would be
fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted fancied by now that the man was a
German. But, then, he had that Danish
newspaper. Maybe he was not.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do at your place&mdash;Wayland,
I think you said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I go to the Academy there. I belong to
the Scouts&mdash;it is military and academic.&#8221;
The boy was quite young and quite simple,
Schmidt decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that military business is bad, very
bad. There will never be war anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted wondered if the man really believed
it. He could not make up his mind. So
they talked. The man grew less and less
interested. He had made up his mind that
the boy was really going to see his mother.
Of course, that would be proven when they
found out how much the mother knew about
it and if she would meet the boy. Probably
all this time had been wasted, but Schmidt
had no regrets. After all, eternal vigilance
was the watchword.</p>
<p>An hour later the train came into the
station.</p>
<p>Ted, who had been quite tired, no longer
felt any weariness. Here was Chicago, here
was home.</p>
<p>As he stepped away from the train, his
mother and sister ran forward. Two men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
watched him from close by&mdash;one motioned
to the other. O&#8217;Reilly went forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, are you looking for Mr.
Strong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen interrupted: &#8220;Looking for Mr.
Who? Why, of course he&#8217;s not&mdash;he&#8217;s my
brother&mdash;I guess you are mistaken. Come,
Ted, we are going home first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted did not question his sister; he knew
there was method in her outburst. He
added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you came, Ted. How I hoped
you would!&#8221; his mother said.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Reilly turned doubtfully, as the other
man beckoned him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time lost,&#8221; said Schmidt. &#8220;Let them
go. No harm done. I pumped the boy on
the way; he had no secret, apparently. He
is but a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was scared by that girl,&#8221; replied
O&#8217;Reilly musingly. &#8220;My, she&#8217;s a Tartar.
All right, then, I&#8217;m tired and I&#8217;m going
home. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, my friend&mdash;see you tomorrow.&#8221;
Schmidt watched him go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, sis, I did have to meet a Mr.
Strong.&#8221; Ted spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Ted, but that man was not
he. When we get away somewhere I&#8217;ll tell
you something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go home. I&#8217;m crazy to be back
here and it certainly feels fine.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>TED MEETS STRONG</h3>
</div>
<p>There were many eager questions on
the way home. The mother listened
with great pride to Ted&#8217;s account, even
though he had told many of the same things
in his letters.</p>
<p>Ted painted a great picture of his new
home and it made Mrs. Marsh very happy
for his sake, even though she wished a little
longingly that both Helen and she could be
a part of this wonderful and happy life.</p>
<p>Helen must have been thinking the same
thing, for she spoke out:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish mother and I could go out there.
If there were only something I could do
there. My work here is interesting, but I
would gladly give it up for such an opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, sis,&#8221; replied Ted. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t be long before you will both be out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
there. I wouldn&#8217;t want to stay myself if I
did not feel sure of that.&#8221; They had reached
their &#8220;L&#8221; station by now and home was only
a matter of a few moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are tired, Ted. But I think
I had better tell you what Mr. Strong wants
you to do.&#8221; Then Helen told him of her
going down to see Mr. Strong, how the latter
had reason to believe that there was to
be a meeting of the Germans the very next
night. He wanted to see Ted, who was to
go to a certain number on Adams Street at
eight the next morning. She gave him the
number of the room. Ted was to wait until
such time as Strong came. He might be
late, for often there was difficulty in getting
there unobserved. He would mention the
word Dean and Helen for identification,
should it be necessary.</p>
<p>Ted went to bed and slept the sleep of the
just and the weary.</p>
<p>That next morning the newspapers printed
in large headlines the ultimatum that
Austria had put up to Servia. They speculated
on the possibilities of war. To Ted&mdash;refreshed
and no longer weary, reading the
newspaper as he made his way downtown&mdash;it
brought a feeling that he was in some way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
involved. It made him feel quite important;
it increased his respect for the men who had
sent him to Chicago. It was big work these
men were doing; he was having a share in
it. He left the elevated station with some
time on his hand. It seemed so long since
he had been down here in the heart of Chicago.
It came to Ted that it would always
hold a warm spot in his affections. After
all, it was here he had spent his childhood;
it was to the knockabouts received here that
he owed much. If only he could be successful,
if only he could obtain the necessary information
and be able to deliver the message
to John Strong. Without knowing very
much about it all, he realized that the things
for him to do were important parts of it all.
A little uncertainly, because the subject was
a little too much for him, and he was still a
very young boy, he speculated on why nations
should go to war.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ted,&#8221; someone greeted him. It
was Spot, the fellow with whom he had had
that fight at the beginning of this story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Spot,&#8221; Ted greeted him cordially.
He was glad to renew old acquaintances.
&#8220;How&#8217;s business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; answered Spot. &#8220;Lots of news,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
lots of papers sold. What are you here for?
Thought you went &#8217;way out West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just paying a visit,&#8221; laughed Ted.
&#8220;Seeing friends.&#8221; They talked for a few
minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you again, Spot. Is this your regular
stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure is,&#8221; replied Spot, as he turned to a
customer.</p>
<p>Ted went on his way. Very soon he
reached the building on Adams street to
which Helen had directed him. He turned
in and when he came to the seventh floor
he entered Room 701.</p>
<p>He accosted the man who looked up from
a desk with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Want a boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps.&#8221; He sounded very English.
&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Theodore Marsh,&#8221; replied the owner of
that name.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s manner changed on the instant.
Ted liked him then. &#8220;Come in, Ted.
Mr. Strong is expected any minute, but of
course he may not come for a while. We
have just moved in here. We have to move
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
quite often, for those Germans certainly are
shrewd. Quick, too, and they keep us on
the jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to work on an intricate little
machine which had a long coil of wire, very
thin, much thinner than a telephone wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what this is?&#8221; Ted did
not know.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dictaphone. We will have use for it.
I am getting it ready for tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted had heard of a dictaphone, but he had
not yet learned its usefulness. He was to
find out that night how wonderfully useful
it could be, how much danger the use of it
would avoid.</p>
<p>It was almost two hours before a man entered.
When he saw Ted he said, with a
smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, my boy. I guess you and I have
met both Dean and Helen, haven&#8217;t we? Let
us go into this room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted delivered the papers he had brought
for Strong. Strong took them eagerly and
just as eagerly Ted gave them up. He
heaved a sigh of relief at getting rid of
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This paper alone,&#8221; Strong picked up one
of the papers from his desk, where he had
placed them, &#8220;if trouble should come, would
prove to the United States Government
what the Germans are doing in the States
and just how it affects Canada. Without
this it would be disagreeable to be found
doing some of the things we find ourselves
compelled to do. I see, also, that this letter
says that I may count on your help. We
will need it, I am sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight, the Germans are to hold a
meeting. The purpose and decision reached
there we must know at all costs. We must
go down there, you and Walker and I.
Walker is the man in the office. He has the
necessary knowledge to place a dictaphone
or tap a telephone wire. Also, he, another
man named Bronson, and I have already
made arrangements for placing that dictaphone
at the Germans&#8217; meeting-place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Walker. &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In about five minutes,&#8221; replied Walker,
with a grin.</p>
<p>While they were waiting Strong suddenly
thought of something.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As I understand&mdash;am I right?&mdash;you
were a newsboy up to a year ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I was,&#8221; answered Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Do you think you could manage
to fix yourself up as one and meet us in
front of the Auditorium?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can,&#8221; replied the boy, after a
moment&#8217;s thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll give you forty-five minutes,&#8221;
Strong said, as he turned to Walker,
who was now ready.</p>
<p>Quickly, Ted located Spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do, Spot,&#8221; he confided
to the news merchant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you
two dollars and my clothes for your clothes
and papers. I want you to have a share in
my good fortune and I also want to sell
papers for awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spot grinned delight. &#8220;You mean it,
Ted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Where can we change?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any place will suit me. But I&#8217;ll show
you a place. That&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A place was very easily located. Spot had
managed to wash his hands and face, while
Ted&#8217;s had not yet gotten to the color they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
should be. They had exchanged everything
from shoes to hats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going now, Spot?&#8221; asked
Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; replied Spot. &#8220;My
name is Mr. James Sullivan. I would have
you address your betters properly, boy.&#8221;
He never cracked a smile as he walked off,
but Ted laughed uproariously.</p>
<p>A little later two men came out of the
Auditorium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paper, sir, papers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered one of them. The other
took a second look at the newsboy and
laughed. &#8220;He certainly fooled you, Strong.
It&#8217;s Ted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, Ted,&#8221; Strong said, with appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slip into that automobile while we stand
in front of it.&#8221; They walked toward it.
&#8220;Now, quick.&#8221; The machine was off to the
German meeting-place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>SETTING A TRAP</h3>
</div>
<p>The automobile came to a stop two blocks
from the German meeting-place.</p>
<p>As the three walked toward it, a beggar
stopped Strong. The latter gave him some
coins. Ted, who was watching, saw a paper
pass between the two. It was so quickly
done that he was not even sure of it. He
made no comment, as he knew that Strong
would mention it, if he thought it necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The room is on the third floor,&#8221; Strong
said. &#8220;There is someone in it now. That
beggar has just been up there; he has been
watching the house all morning, so that he
could keep me in touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose, Ted, you go up and sell your
papers. Go to every office. When you reach
Room 318, size it up as well as you can. See
what you can of 316 and 320 also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All our work and our preparations have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
been from 418,&#8221; Walker added. &#8220;Our
friends are there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Strong said, &#8220;take a look in there,
even though you will meet Bronson a little
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>A boy tried to sell his papers in the many
offices. He canvassed each floor and in due
time reached the fourth. He came to Room
418 and saw a sign on the glass reading as
follows:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>TERENCE McMAHON<br />
INSURANCE AGENT AND ADJUSTER<br />
MAIN OFFICE&mdash;OLIVER BUILDING<br />
<br />
  Russell Bronson, Br. Mgr.<br /></p>
<p>He entered. &#8220;Want a paper?&#8221; he asked
one of the men.</p>
<p>The man took one. Ted glanced about
and then went out. He had some idea of
the room. He noticed that three other doors
seemed to belong to the same office, Rooms
422, 420 and 416.</p>
<p>He soon reached the third floor. He went
through the same routine, just as carefully
and matter-of-factedly, as he had done on
the other floors. When he reached 320 he
found the door locked and a hand pointing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
to 318 as the entrance. On the glass of that
door he saw a sign which read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>NOVELTIES AND TOYS<br />
A. CHRISTENSEN<br /></p>
<p>Ted opened the door. A man was inside,
his feet perched upon a desk and he was
reading a German newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paper, sir?&#8221; Ted asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the answer. He did not even
glance up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a Staats-Zeitung and a Wochen-Blatt,&#8221;
coaxed Ted. All this time he was
taking stock of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Wochen-Blatt? I&#8217;ll take one,&#8221; the
man became interested. He offered a half
dollar to Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the change, but I will get it for
you.&#8221; Ted was fighting for time, so that he
could form impressions.</p>
<p>&#8220;And run away with my money?&#8221; the
man sneered. &#8220;Not on your life. I&#8217;ll wait
until later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hold all my papers. I&#8217;ll come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man grudgingly gave the boy the
money. At the corner store Ted found his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
two friends; the automobile had long since
left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work,&#8221; Strong commented, after
hearing Ted. &#8220;Now, how can we get that
fellow out of the building for half an hour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I suggested going out for the
change,&#8221; volunteered Ted, &#8220;he didn&#8217;t want
to trust me and said: &#8216;I&#8217;ll wait until later.&#8217;
Perhaps he intends going out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here is one way to coax him to go
a little sooner. A German wants what he
wants when he wants it, and he never stops
wanting it until he gets it. When you go
back, Ted, insist on being paid twice as
much as the paper sells for. He probably
will not pay it. He will consider it a holdup.
But he will want that paper and it may
hurry his departure. It is almost lunch-time
anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walker, you go to all the news-stands
within three square blocks and also any
stores you may see that sell newspapers and
buy up any Wochen-Blatts they have. That
ought to keep our friend busy trying to get
what he wants and so give us more time.
We will all meet in Room 418. I&#8217;ll steal up
while you two are wrangling over your high-handed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
outrage, Ted. Walker can come any
time. There is small chance that he will be
recognized. You see,&#8221; Strong added, his
eyes smiling, &#8220;that&#8217;s the value of having the
ordinary face Walker has. He looks like
seventy-five million other folks, so no one
would notice him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted rushed back to the office. &#8220;Everybody
is poor around here or else they don&#8217;t want
to make change. My, what trouble.&#8221; He
was counting out the change and he now
placed but forty cents on the man&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The man picked up the money and for a
moment it looked as if he would not count
it, but he did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, boy, another nickel! You&#8217;re short
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. I took a nickel for all the
trouble I had in making change.&#8221; Ted felt
mean and he knew his argument was a poor
one, but he was doing it for a purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five cents, or I don&#8217;t want the paper.&#8221;
He made a threatening motion toward Ted.</p>
<p>Ted laughed at him. He threw the dime
on the desk, picked up his paper and backed
out of the door. The man was muttering
fiercely in German.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>Out on the street our hero watched from
a nearby door. It was just mid-day and
people were hurrying for their lunch. But
it was at least twenty minutes before he saw
his man walk out of the building. He
watched him and saw him stop at one, then
at another stand and try to obtain the desired
paper. He was not successful and Ted
saw him stroll further down the street.</p>
<p>Two minutes later Ted was in Room 418.
Walker joined them almost at the same
time.</p>
<p>Ted was introduced to the man to whom
he had sold a paper a little earlier and then
the party got down to business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walker, jump down and try the door,&#8221;
said Strong. &#8220;Here is the key.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a new problem presented itself when
Walker reported back that the key would
not fit the lock and Strong, incredulous, had
proven the truth of it for himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; whistled Strong. &#8220;They must
have changed the lock. They figured the old
one was too easy for anyone who had a mind
to enter. Come on, Walker, we&#8217;ll try the
window.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they found no way of entering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
through the window. It was securely fastened.
Walker, with one foot on the edge
of the fire-escape and the other on the ledge
of the next room&#8217;s window and holding himself
secure with one hand, attempted to open
that window also, but found it just as securely
locked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still one way before we think of
any rough stuff,&#8221; said Strong. With the
other three he went down to the third floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Ted, get on my shoulders and try
the fanlight. Let&#8217;s pray that it opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>It opened so very easily that they all
laughed. But they found that neither
Walker, Strong nor Bronson could get
through. But Ted could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bronson, &#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s up
to the boy, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is,&#8221; said Strong.</p>
<p>Walker now very quickly, yet very clearly
explained the workings and the manipulations
of the dictaphone. Ted listened carefully
as he was told how the wires should
be laid and connected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Ted,&#8221; Walker continued, &#8220;the
whole thing is already prepared. We knew
how little time we would have when the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
did come, so we did everything we could
beforehand. You will find a place for these
wires on the wall behind the steam-pipes.
The floor moulding running along the window
wall will move if you remove the screws&mdash;four
of them. Then count off the sixteenth
floor board&mdash;you work it this way,&#8221;
Walker showed Ted how, &#8220;and it will pry
loose. It is all very simple and should take
no more than twenty minutes. It would
take me ten.</p>
<p>&#8220;The floor-board has a little groove into
which the wires will fit. You will find that
where this board ends is another piece of
moulding which will most surprisingly give
way to your magic fingers, and the screwdriver,
as did the moulding at the other end.
On the big cabinet that is there, try that
corner of it nearest you and against the wall,
and there you will find that your wires will
fit snugly. Your hands are small and can
get in there, back of the cabinet. You just
can&#8217;t go wrong. On top of the cabinet see
that the mouthpiece or, rather, the listener,
is propped up so that it faces the table. If
you have any doubts call out&mdash;we will be
here. You will also find that it will not be
seen, for the cabinet is high.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, Ted, about leaving things
just as they were. It all will fit back snugly.
Be twice as careful as you are quick,&#8221;
Strong warned him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be up here, Bronson will be one
flight below, and the beggar is watching in
the street. Walker will be up above passing
the wires down to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than fifteen minutes had already
been consumed. Strong had warned Ted to
open the window of Room 420 and, should
a warning come, hide in that room. A rope
would be passed down for him from the window
above.</p>
<p>Ted got to work at once. He found it
even more simple than Walker had told him.
In fifteen or twenty minutes he called out.
&#8220;I think I am through.&#8221; He took another
look about. He had carefully seen to everything
and there was no sign of any disturbance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Strong. There was
a pause. Then he heard Strong speaking to
him again, &#8220;Say something right out, not
too loud, just ordinary conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to buy a paper? News, Post,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
American, Staats-Zeitung?&#8221; said Ted to the
empty air.</p>
<p>There was another pause, then he heard
Walker say to Strong, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine and distinct,
old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted took another look about. He lifted
himself on the door-knob and then eager
hands helped him out. Walker ran down
the fire escape to take a look around the
room and Strong hoisted himself up on the
knob and also looked about. Ted&#8217;s work
had been thorough and neither of them made
any criticisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something of a relief,&#8221; said
Walker. Ted closed the fanlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to do until tonight,&#8221; and Walker
grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat,&#8221; said Strong. &#8220;Coming with
us, Bronson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>STRONG SEEMS CHECKMATED</h3>
</div>
<p>Ted was too excited to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better eat, lad,&#8221; said Walker. &#8220;We
do not know when we will get another
chance today. If no one else seemed to be
following his advice, he himself considered
it good enough to heed. He was eating
enough for two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine it is going to be risky business
tonight,&#8221; Bronson remarked. &#8220;I wish I
could be with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s either going to be that, or it is going
to be very simple,&#8221; Strong answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the trouble with all adventure,
these days,&#8221; Walker complained. &#8220;It&#8217;s always
so very simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider this extremely interesting
and exciting,&#8221; replied Strong. &#8220;It is like
a tremendous game of chess with enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
elements of danger added to suit the most
exacting. Don&#8217;t imagine that we shall not
be in danger every second tonight. These
Germans are cold-blooded. If we should
happen to be in their way, should they find
out how much we actually know, we can say
good-bye; the sun would rise tomorrow, but
we might not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Ted. &#8220;Well, lad, are you
afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stick, of course,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, comrades, here is the plan. The
keys you see here, one for each of us, are
for Room 420. We shall separate. At six-thirty
we must all plan to be in that room.
No noise must be made when you come; no
sound must be made while you are there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had better make sure we do all our
sneezing outside, eh?&#8221; Every one laughed
with Walker.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be your last sneeze, if it&#8217;s inside,&#8221;
Strong laughingly warned him. &#8220;The least
sound, a scraping chair, would be heard.
Stay in Room 420; the fire escape makes 418
dangerous, if anyone should be curious and
decide to come up and look into that room.
Of course, there will be no lights turned on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Should any of us fail to get there, he
who does must make every effort to get the
import of the conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do anything, before I leave for
New York tonight?&#8221; asked Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I guess not. Get your room into
shape for us. Put the chairs where we cannot
stumble over them. How long will you
be gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. These Germans certainly
keep us busy. Some of our optimists are
turning pessimists, now that Austria is declaring
war against Servia. They are beginning
to think that perhaps there is something
in this war-talk. I have to go to them
and tell them just how much there really is
in it. I had much rather stay&mdash;wish I
could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, Bronson, and there is no
one I would rather have. But perhaps you
will be of better service there. I shall code
Wright the information we get tonight, if
we get it. They will have it at the New York
office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong and Walker returned to the Adams
street office; Ted went home. He was glad
of the chance to see more of his mother;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Helen, he knew, would not be home. Ted
was very fond of his pretty, efficient sister,
and proud of her rapid rise at the store.</p>
<p>He found his mother there when he
reached home. He explained the reason for
his wearing the newsboy&#8217;s clothes.</p>
<p>Ted spent a quiet, comfortable afternoon
with her. Many things they still had to talk
about and the mother realized how much it
was the desire of Ted to have her and Helen
come out to that great West, a land where
contentment and opportunity, at least, were
more likely to be found than in this place, in
which she had lived so many years.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>About three o&#8217;clock, only a half hour after
he had been at Adams street, Strong was
called to the telephone. He had been busy
at a report, the call was unexpected and
could only come from his secretary or from
Ted, the only two besides Walker who knew
of this new location.</p>
<p>It proved to be his secretary.</p>
<p>&#8220;A messenger boy came here a little while
ago with a message for you,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A meeting is to be held at W.&#8217;s house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
If you will come, can get you in. 4:30!&#8217; It
is signed &#8216;J.&#8217;,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>There was a pause. She continued: &#8220;It
looks as if it comes from Jones. It is his
writing, beyond doubt, but he signed his
initial instead of his number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come right over,&#8221; Strong answered,
and his voice sounded perplexed.</p>
<p>Charles Jones was an operative, employed
as a butler by the Winckel household. He
had so often given proof of profound stupidity
in everything except his duties in the
household that Herr Winckel would have
laughed at any suspicion of his being anything
else but a butler. Herr Winckel was
so fond of saying and repeating that the man
had a butler mind it could never grasp anything
outside of that.</p>
<p>In reality, Jones was shrewd, keen, able
to obtain information without creating suspicion.
He had been one of Strong&#8217;s best
men and the latter felt he could count on
him.</p>
<p>Could it be a trap, he wondered?</p>
<p>Strong was uncertain as to what he should
do. To miss this meeting, which perhaps
was important; to go there, on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
hand, and endanger the chances of his getting
to that night meeting?</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew what to do, Walker.&#8221;
Together they went over the phases of it as
they walked down to the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go,&#8221; advised Walker. &#8220;You say that
the boy could do his part. If they do want
you out of the way, should this be a trap,
they will hold us until morning; they would
not dare hold us any longer. And, if they
do, they will not feel the need for carefulness
and the boy will thus have a better
chance. It works well both ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they came to the office, Strong read
the message again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go, Walker,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;Dress
up. Be sure not to carry any papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two men came out of one of the inner
offices a few minutes later. They would
have been taken anywhere for two English
servants; they might have been valets, footmen,
even butlers. Each one looked the
other over critically, but the disguise was
thorough.</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes past the hour they
reached the Winckel house, knocked at the
servants&#8217; entrance. The maid answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
and they asked for Mr. Jones. They
appeared to be very superior, upper-class
servants. Very English, too. She escorted
them in and then opened a door for them to
enter. They passed through. As they did,
each one of them was pounced upon. They
struggled against the sickening smell of the
chloroform held tightly against their noses.
Then they knew nothing more for a while.</p>
<p>An hour later they awoke with a feeling
of nausea and the smell of chloroform all
about them. They found themselves tied
hand and foot and unable to move. From
all appearances they seemed to be in the
cellar of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you there, chief?&#8221; asked Walker, in
a sick and very low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m here; going to stay awhile, I
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what happened? Suppose
they got on to&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are probably gloating somewhere
within earshot,&#8221; Strong warned him in a
whisper. &#8220;They certainly have us out of
the way for the time being,&#8221; he added, ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing to do; we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
caught,&#8221; Walker said, in his ordinary voice.
Then, in a voice so low Strong could barely
hear him, he inquired, &#8220;Are you pretty well
tied? Can you do anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t even move,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; Walker said dejectedly.
&#8220;They made a good job.&#8221;</p>
<p>At five o&#8217;clock Ted left home for downtown.
He stopped off to buy some of the
late editions of the newspapers and proceeded
to the meeting-place. He made his
rounds through several buildings and at last
reached that particular one.</p>
<p>There was no one watching, however.
With Strong out of the way the Germans
felt quite secure.</p>
<p>At five-thirty he had already let himself
into Room 420 and was preparing to make
himself comfortable. He picked up the dictaphone
every few minutes, but for a long
time heard nothing. Things seemed quiet
and he began to wonder where Strong and
Walker were, what was delaying them. His
heart was going at a great rate because of
the forced quiet and the excited state of his
mind.</p>
<p>Things would depend on him if the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
men did not come. Would he be able to
carry out the plans?</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only do my best,&#8221; the boy said to
himself. And there was a strong determination
to make that best count.</p>
<p>It was now half past seven. He lifted the
dictaphone oftener. Very soon he heard
voices, very indistinct, but as he listened
they became clearer and clearer. Then he
began making out the words and the sense
of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said one voice. &#8220;We found out
that this man Jones, who was Winckel&#8217;s
butler, was one of their men. He dropped a
card which young Winckel found. That was
enough to warrant his being watched, although
we did nothing for several days except
to see that he got no further information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, at the point of a gun, we forced
him to write a note to Strong telling him
that there was to be a meeting at Winckel&#8217;s
house at four-thirty and that he could get
him in. Strong with another man came. We
trapped them, bound them and they are now
in the cellar out of harm&#8217;s way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>Ted welcomed the information. At least
he knew just what to expect.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for our friends to be
here, isn&#8217;t it? What time is Captain Knabe
coming?&#8221; said a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;At about fifteen minutes after eight. He
is coming with Winckel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Schmidt, it was a good piece of
business to get Strong out of the way. He
is too dangerous and resourceful to suit us.&#8221;
This from O&#8217;Reilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been a nuisance, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; answered
Schmidt. &#8220;Hello, friends,&#8221; he said
to some new-comers. &#8220;I have just been telling
O&#8217;Reilly about our little affair this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the sound of a number of voices
and of some laughing. Then more men came
into the room, there was the scraping of
chairs as men seated themselves.</p>
<p>Then there was quiet as two men entered.
Greetings were exchanged and Ted realized
that the two were Winckel and Captain
Knabe.</p>
<p>As Captain Knabe was introduced to
some of the men, Ted wrote the names down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let us get down to business, friends,&#8221;
said one, who seemed to be the chairman.
&#8220;Captain Knabe has come here from Washington,
his time just now is important. Even
more important is the need for immediate
action. Captain Knabe, gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE DICTAPHONE AT WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Captain
Knabe, &#8220;that some of the Irish gentlemen
present do not understand German, and
so, while I can do so much better in my native
tongue, I shall talk in English.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How lucky,&#8221; thought Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, I have good news for
you&mdash;war is to be declared the day after tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the sound of moving, falling
chairs, of men getting to their feet. Then
a whispered toast&mdash;a whisper that was almost
loud because of the number of voices&mdash;&#8220;Der
Tag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, in America, who have never given
up your allegiance to the supreme nation,
nor to the emperor, must do your share. Although
war is to be declared the day after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
tomorrow, it will be a matter of a few more
days before we are at war with England;
possibly it will be more than a week. I understand
you are ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another voice spoke. &#8220;We are prepared.
We will announce picnics at certain places;
it is for you to tell us the locations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready to tell you that now,&#8221; replied
the captain. &#8220;Concentrate on your picnic
grounds near Detroit for the taking of
Windsor. Herr Winckel has the plans. I
have given him three sets&mdash;Windsor, Toronto,
Winnipeg. He also has the charts
which show how to move and what railroads
to occupy. Our friends in Canada are to see
that there are available cars, engines and
even motors. Of course, all of you will know
just what picnic grounds are to be selected,
so we need waste no time on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men have you, Herr
Winckel?&#8221; Captain Knabe wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell us, Schoen?&#8221; Herr Winckel
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Approximately, armed and ready for the
call, one hundred and twenty-five thousand
men. There are also forty thousand Irishmen.
O&#8217;Reilly has them equally prepared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
and ready. Pfeffer reports thirty thousand
men in Canada, eager for the call. They are
so stationed that we can throw one hundred
and fifty thousand men on Windsor and Toronto
or such other points as are within one
half day&#8217;s ordinary travel. For Montreal we
would need eighteen hours&#8217; additional notice.
For Quebec we would need thirty. We
figure that thirty thousand men will be
enough for Winnipeg, although we shall
have more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fool Englishmen,&#8221; sneered a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not such fools, Schmidt. Do not underestimate
them.&#8221; The voice was Winckel&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything looks so easy,&#8221; said another
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said Captain Knabe, &#8220;we cannot
help but win. But the Englishman fights
best with his back to the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have your commands assigned, have
you not?&#8221; the captain inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; replied Schoen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen, here is the thing of the
utmost importance,&#8221; Herr Winckel spoke
warningly. &#8220;The facts must not leak; they
must not get to the United States officials.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
That is so important that the whole plan will
have to be dropped if there is any suspicion
as to a leak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a number of us will bear out
what Winckel says,&#8221; O&#8217;Reilly spoke up.
&#8220;For myself, and I think I speak for the
other Irishmen here present and also for the
forty thousand against England, but against
the United States&mdash;never. Not one Irishman
can be counted on if it comes to a showdown
against the U. S. A.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor very many Germans,&#8221; added
Winckel.</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it,&#8221; said Captain Knabe. &#8220;Shall
we go over the ammunition storehouses,
those that are in Canada and those that are
in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the places Ted could not make
out, others he did. He realized that this was
valuable information. Names though they
were, they were clues and so might be important.</p>
<p>Much more was said by the many men and
Ted stored up in his mind such information
as he thought would be useful. At half past
ten all the men had left and from what Ted
heard he understood that Knabe, Winckel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
O&#8217;Reilly and Schoen were adjourning to
some other place to perfect plans.</p>
<p>Ted cautiously stretched himself. He was
wary and still watchful. Although his muscles
were stiff and his bones ached, he had
not dared to move. When he was fairly certain
that he could move, he indulged in that
luxury for at least five minutes. He had no
trouble in leaving the building. Once outside,
he hastened to a telephone booth. He
had no intention of telephoning, but he did
want to find out the address of Winckel. A
plan was in his mind.</p>
<p>He found two Winckels in the telephone.
He decided that in all likelihood it was the
one on Michigan avenue, the other was
somewhere on the North Side.</p>
<p>When he came to the first cross street he
saw a passing taxi and hailed it. The driver
had some suspicion as to the ability of his
customer to pay, for Ted was still in his
newsboy&#8217;s clothes. However, Ted proved
he had the necessary funds and satisfied the
chauffeur.</p>
<p>Ted left the taxi two blocks before he
reached the Winckel residence. The inside
of the house was almost, not quite dark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Stealthily the boy investigated. He decided
that any entrance would have to be made
from the rear or the side of the building.
The rear windows to the basement and the
door he found were locked.</p>
<p>The boy studied the situation. He saw
where he could enter through one place, but
it would mean that he would have to remove
a window glass. He decided against that.
There was danger of being heard.</p>
<p>Though Ted was seeking an entrance he
had not as yet made up his mind to try to go
to the rescue of his friends. To go into the
building and take chances? But then, after
all, his information could be of use to Strong
only, for he held the many threads.</p>
<p>It would be folly to call the police, Strong
would not care to have the publicity, and
then, too, the two men might not be there
after all.</p>
<p>He decided, come what may, he would go
in. He felt fairly certain that Winckel
would not be in the house nor would he
return for an hour or more. Before making
any further attempt to get inside, Ted went
to a nearby drug store. He obtained paper
and stamped envelope and wrote the following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
message to Strong&#8217;s office, addressing it
to Strong&#8217;s secretary, Miss Ford.</p>
<table summary='special format' style='margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%'>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><p>&#8220;Unless you hear from us in the early
morning, you will find us imprisoned in the
cellar of Mr. Winckel&#8217;s house. I am now
trying to get Mr. Strong and Mr. Walker
out, but may not succeed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align='left'>&#8220;11:15 p.m.</td>
<td align='right'>Ted.&#8221;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Having mailed the letter he hurried back
to the house. Cautiously he prowled about,
trying to find a way into the basement.
There was no way.</p>
<p>At any ordinary time Ted would have said
it was impossible to get up on that ledge,
but he managed it now. The house entrance
was through a wide door, but one had to go
down three steps and it made the floor an
English basement. The floor above that was
much higher than most ground floors and
yet lower than most second floors. Ted crept
along the narrow ledge holding on to such
supports as were there. He reached a big
window and by careful manipulation and
urging the boy managed to force it open.</p>
<p>He crawled in. Spot&#8217;s suit was very useful
now, for it held matches. Ted did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
intend to use any unless he had to, but the
building was strange to him and the occasion
for the use of them might arise. He
knew that he would have two floors to travel,
the one to the basement and the one to the
cellar. He got down the one floor without
mishap. He was about to begin the exploration
of that floor for the entrance to the
cellar, when he heard the key being inserted
into the street door.</p>
<p>His heart leaped within him. Two people
entered, a man and woman. They switched
on a light. If these people had come thirty
seconds earlier he would have been caught
coming down the stairs, Ted thought, as he
crouched behind the turn of the staircase.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nice of you to see me home, Mr.
Erkin,&#8221; said the young lady. &#8220;Will you be
good enough to let the light burn, as some
of the folks are not in yet? Come and see
me some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, thank you, I will,&#8221; the man
answered and left.</p>
<p>The boy thought, &#8220;Well, I certainly
should be called Lucky. Here I wonder how
to find an entrance to the cellar and they are
kind enough to turn on a light for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>It was fairly easy for Ted to find his way
now, but because of the light he had to use
even greater care.</p>
<p>The cellar seemed deserted, when he got
there. It was pitch dark and it took several
minutes for him to grow accustomed to the
extreme darkness. Then he heard the faint
murmur of voices.</p>
<p>Strong and Walker had slept fitfully and
had been wide awake at various times.
Strong had again been awakened and was
insisting that Walker listen to him.</p>
<p>As Ted drew nearer, he heard Strong say,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think, the way I feel, I shall ever
be able to move again. But if I knew that
Ted was just the least bit successful I could
be forever content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor child&mdash;if he did anything at
all,&#8221; Walker answered, &#8220;it would be wonderful.
It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s job, what, then, could
a boy do?&#8221;</p>
<p>As if in answer to the question, they heard
a low voice call, &#8220;Mr. Strong, Mr. Strong!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; the startled voice of
Strong demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Ted!&#8221; said that ungrammatical
young man, a bit excitedly.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, boy. Is it really you?
Have you a match?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted struck one. Hurriedly he untied the
two men, who were already questioning him
excitedly and to whom he whispered assurances.</p>
<p>As they turned the corner (having left the
building without trouble) Strong looked
back. An auto passed north on Michigan
avenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Winckel&#8217;s car,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
weren&#8217;t any too soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted told the two men of the night&#8217;s adventures
and they both listened eagerly.
Strong was laboring under great excitement
as the boy went on with his story. When
Ted was through he placed his hand on
Ted&#8217;s shoulder and said, quietly and very
impressively, to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I simply can&#8217;t tell you the things I long
to say. You&#8217;re going to be a man, my boy!
This is a day&#8217;s work of which you will always
be proud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing what we know, we can go to
sleep tonight, awake in the morning with a
plan as to just what we will do. I could
almost cry with contentment. This news
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
you bring is what we have long striven to
learn, and along comes Ted Marsh&mdash;Lucky,
the Boy Scout&mdash;and makes Canada and
England his very grateful and humble servants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several things we know we
can do now,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We had best take
a night to sleep it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a wonder, Ted, my friend,&#8221;
added Walker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, let us go,&#8221; said Strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all weary. I hate to leave you.
I&#8217;d like to celebrate, but I guess we had
better postpone it until tomorrow. See you
at eight.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>WINCKEL CALLS A HALT</h3>
</div>
<p>There were glaring headlines in the
newspapers the next morning. War was
on. People who had doubted all along, who
could not believe it possible, now had to believe.
And, although England was as yet
not involved, no one was optimistic enough
to imagine that she would stay out of it.</p>
<p>Around newspaper offices, everywhere,
excited, eager groups discussed it all. Many
a man heard the thrilling call of his native
land and many listened and made plans to
return to either Germany, Russia, England
or France.</p>
<p>Yet neither in headlines nor in the ordinary
run of news, was there mention made
of the events of our story. Silent, powerful
forces were at work to keep it quiet.</p>
<p>The automobile of Herr Winckel stopped
before his house and from it Schmidt,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
O&#8217;Reilly and the owner alighted. They
made their way to the cellar, a precaution
as to the safekeeping of the prisoners.
O&#8217;Reilly and Schmidt were to be guests of
Winckel for the night. Much work had been
planned for the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quiet, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; said Schmidt, as
Winckel started to turn on the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they are asleep,&#8221; remarked
O&#8217;Reilly. The light glared. A moment&#8217;s
hush. There were astonished and wondering
exclamations. The ropes which had
held the prisoners tied, were strewn about,
but the prisoners were nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can it mean?&#8221; exclaimed Winckel,
searching vainly for an explanation.</p>
<p>Wild guesses were made by the three as
to how the escape was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Winckel after awhile,
&#8220;never mind how they escaped, the important
thing is&mdash;how much have they found
out of our plans.&#8221; He showed plainly how
disturbed he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can they have found out about our
plans? Pretty far fetched to imagine that
they could have obtained any information&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
chances are that they did not escape
until late this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Reilly interrupted Schmidt. &#8220;Is there
any way in which we can find out the last
time someone in the house saw the prisoners?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Winckel. &#8220;We shall
soon find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The household was awakened. Inquiries
and investigation showed that Lauer, a
trusted employee of Winckel, had taken a
last look at the prisoners at about ten
o&#8217;clock. He was certain of that; he had
heard their voices, although he could not
make out what they spoke about.</p>
<p>There were sighs of relief from Schmidt
and O&#8217;Reilly, who felt that the situation
was covered, but Winckel was more skeptical
and less canny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will admit that they were here until
ten o&#8217;clock and later. I will even admit
that they were not listening at the conference.
But how was their escape managed
and why after ten? Did they have outside
help and how did the outside help know of
their imprisonment here?</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of you gentlemen may be tired and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
may wish to retire. Please do so, if you
want to. I am going down to our meeting
place to see what I can see. A little late,
I will admit, and it may not do us much
good, but there is always a chance. It is
important for us to find out if we have
blundered, if our plans have been disclosed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Schmidt and O&#8217;Reilly insisted on
accompanying Winckel and the three left
the house in the next five minutes.</p>
<p>They reached the building in about twenty
minutes. No policeman was about to see
them violate the speed laws on the way.
An immediate and careful search of the
room was made, to see if anyone had been
there since they left and also for any clue
as to the probable leak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing seems wrong as far as I can
see,&#8221; O&#8217;Reilly started to say. &#8220;Hello, what
is this?&#8221; He had discovered the cleverly
concealed wires of the dictaphone. Winckel
and Schmidt joined him on the instant.
They traced the wires and soon found out
the whole layout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mischief is certainly afoot,&#8221; exclaimed
Schmidt. The other men said nothing, but
studied the proposition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There still is a chance,&#8221; said O&#8217;Reilly
In an unconvincing manner&mdash;as if he wanted
to believe something his better sense did not
permit him to do, &#8220;that this outfit was not
used since Strong and the other man had
been kept from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sickening thought at the same instant
came to Schmidt. &#8220;O&#8217;Reilly, we talked
about the prisoners, how we had trapped
them, where they were&mdash;and all the time
someone was listening. That someone heard
all we had to say and then, after we were
all through, he went up to Winckel&#8217;s house
and rescued them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winckel said nothing for many minutes;
he seemed lost in thought. The other men
waited for him to speak. Finally he did.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a lot of dunces. We were so sure
of ourselves, we felt we were so wise. Pride
goeth before a fall and we fell. We must
give up our plans. It is up to both of you
to get busy, we still have time to keep out
of trouble. There is a ray of comfort in
that, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to think what Knabe and the others
at the embassy will think,&#8221; was the rueful
comment of Schmidt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that bother you. This plan
has failed, we must plan again&mdash;when again
we match wits, let us hope we shall be more
careful and consequently more successful.
Come, enough of post mortems, let&#8217;s get
busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a busy night for all of them. There
were many men who had to be seen and who
in turn had to see others. It was, so they
explained to the others, a matter of life
and death that all preparations cease at
once, as there would be close and careful
watch kept. There was much telephoning
and telegraphing to the friends who were in
other cities.</p>
<p>There can be nothing but thorough admiration
for the effective, capable way these
men went about calling a halt to all activities.
Like a perfect, well oiled machine
which slows down and then ceases its movements,
until there is something tremendously
impressive in its inaction and silence;
like a well-drilled army which retreats magnificently
and in its very retreat almost
gains a victory, so much like all this, was the
action and the work of these men at this
time. They were obeyed as only the Germans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
know how to obey. By morning, there
was no sign, no clue to their plans and activities.
One thing only remained to prove the
danger to Canada that had been. Arsenals
and warehouses holding weapons and vehicles
of war were found at the places shown
on the list that Ted had copied.</p>
<p>At Ottawa and a little later in London and
in Washington, the powers&mdash;the men at the
helm&mdash;found out that what would in all
probability have been a successful invasion
of Canada had been checked. And they
found out, too, just how and in what way it
had been done.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AT OTTAWA</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Come in, both of you,&#8221; Strong called
from the inside office. Ted had shown
up at Strong&#8217;s office early the next day. He
found Strong at his desk and he found afterwards
that he had been there for more than
two hours. His secretary told Ted that he
was telephoning long distance and that Ted
should wait. When the operative was
through talking, he came out and saw Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down a few minutes, Ted, I shall be
busy,&#8221; he had said. He had returned to his
office and proceeded to do some further telephoning.
Walker had come in a little later
and the two were busy going over the evening&#8217;s
events when Strong called out as
above.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ted, I guess we are going to have
war. At least we won the first victory, or
rather you did.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>Ted fidgeted at the praise and grinned
sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Walker, &#8220;if they have,
found the dictaphone as yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can safely figure on the fact that
they did. They started a little investigation
when they found that the birds had flown.
But it does not matter how much they know
we know, now. It&#8217;s a fight in the open from
now on. I&#8217;m thankful for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have already notified Ottawa, New
York, and the different capitals of the provinces.
Washington also knows, our embassy
has already notified them as to the location
of the arsenals. They are going to issue orders
from Ottawa to confiscate those in our
own country at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ottawa wanted all the facts and it got
them. I expect to hear further from them
in the course of the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Walker, &#8220;if our friends
will be polite enough to return my dictaphone.
They should, it does not belong to
them and they probably know to whom, it
does belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might go over and claim it,&#8221; answered
Strong.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I will, just to see old Winckel&#8217;s
face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong turned to Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear lad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what you did isn&#8217;t
the kind of thing that can appear in the
newspapers, but it is the kind about which
history is made. It is a big job you have
accomplished. The men who sent you down
to us made no mistake in their judgment as
to what you could do. Sir Robert Wingate
wanted to know all about you, I must have
talked to him for more than twenty minutes
on the telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walker and I go to Ottawa on a late
train today. They want to see me, to go
fever details.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s get busy with the last threads
of what happened last night&mdash;we have to
put it down on black and white for future,
reference. When do you want to return to
Wayland, Ted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to go by Saturday, if it can
be arranged,&#8221; answered Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think it can be done. I shall return
tomorrow night or early the following
morning. You will be free for these two
days. Have a good time; remember, we pay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
all your expenses&mdash;nothing is too good for
you. If you can, come down the day after
tomorrow. I may have some news for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to come down,&#8221; answered
Ted, as he wondered at the news to which
Strong had reference.</p>
<p>They spent a half hour or more going over
the events of the evening, Strong&#8217;s secretary
taking notes. Then Ted left and returned
home.</p>
<p>That afternoon he took his mother to the
ball game and saw the Cubs defeat the
Giants. He tried to explain the game to his
mother, who pretended an interest and tried
hard to understand. But she found her truant
fancy going elsewhere&mdash;it centered
about this boy of hers, her daughter and also
about the husband who could not endure
the troubleous times, not because of the
hardship to himself so much as the hardship
to her and the child.</p>
<p>Ted&#8217;s interest was not divided, however,
except in rare moments when he would turn
to his mother and accuse her of lack of interest.
She would flush guiltily and pretend
that she was interested. She would ask a
question or two, but her very questions convicted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
her, showed her inability to understand,
and Ted gave it up as a hopeless job
and comforted himself in the belief that only
men understood the game, it was too deep
for women, excepting one or two, who knew
something.</p>
<p>As they rode home the boy and the mother
discussed the improvement in their condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will never have to worry any more,
mother, not as long as I am able,&#8221; the boy
said, with all of youth&#8217;s surety and confidence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marsh wiped an unbidden tear from
her eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very happy, dear. And yet, I
would give so much if your father was one
of us. He was a fine man, but things were
against him, too much so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted did not answer, he felt that nothing
he could say would help.</p>
<p>After a long period of quiet, the boy spoke
a little more quietly: &#8220;Never mind, mother,
you have Helen and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy in my riches,&#8221; answered the
mother proudly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>When they reached home, both of them
began to get the supper ready so that Helen
would not have to wait. A brilliant idea
came to Ted as they prepared. &#8220;Mother,&#8221;
he said excitedly, &#8220;let&#8217;s not eat at home tonight.
We are going to the theater, so let us
have supper out.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first the mother demurred, but she
gave way&mdash;there was great temptation in
the unusual treat. When Helen came home
and was told the plan she was even more
excited than they; it was so unusual an adventure.
You can readily believe that it
was a happy party of three that repaired to one
of the many nice restaurants in the loop
and afterward to the theater. They did not
reach home until late in the night. On the
way home they discussed what the news
could be that Strong would have for Ted.</p>
<p>The next day Ted spent at the Settlement,
renewing old acquaintances. Miss White,
who had taken Mrs. Dean&#8217;s place, was glad
to see him and gave him a hearty welcome.
She was greatly interested in his story of
his year in the West and wanted to know all
about Mrs. Dean. It was a great day for
Ted and the pleasantest of his stay in
Chicago.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>On his way home that night Ted began to
wish for Wayland. He had not realized how
much the place meant to him until now,
Syd Graham and the rest of the boys seemed
very dear, very desirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;that nothing
will keep me from going on Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>TED RECEIVES A REWARD</h3>
</div>
<p>Sir Robert Wingate listened while
John Strong told the story of the plotting
and counterplotting in Chicago. Many
times he made memorandums. He asked
questions once or twice, but in the main he
just listened. When Strong finally completed
his account, Sir Robert said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We took immediate action at our end
and the results are more than satisfying.
Strong, I do not want you to think for a
minute that the importance of what you
men have done is underestimated. The excitement
of the Great War, the necessity of
secrecy as to what you have accomplished&mdash;all
these facts may give you an idea that we
do not consider your work as important as it
is. We do, however. Now, as to this boy,
Theodore Marsh. He must be an unusual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
youngster with a good head. He will bear
watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately for us, he is American.
Those are the kind of boys Canada could use
to advantage. Not only is he American, but
loyally so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he shall have acknowledgment of
his deed of service. Tell me, is he from a
family of wealth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong briefly gave Sir Robert an account
of Ted&#8217;s past. The latter nodded his head
understandingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we will also give a more practical
acknowledgment of the value of his service.
The Government, I am sure, will be glad to
give a reward of $1,000.00 to him. When
you go back to Chicago, you will give him a
letter from me which will also hold a check
for that amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>You would think that both Strong and
Walker were the ones who were receiving
the money, they showed how glad they were.</p>
<p>Strong could not complete his work until
late in the afternoon. Walker and he boarded
a train which brought them into Chicago
about three o&#8217;clock the next afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;This letter and the enclosure will be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
great surprise to Ted, won&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Walker.
&#8220;I certainly am glad of it; he surely deserves
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he does, and I am just as glad. Let
me manage the business of letting him know
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the office, Ted had
already been there. He had left, saying that
he would be back at two o&#8217;clock, when told
that Strong would not arrive until the afternoon.</p>
<p>Promptly at two Ted showed up. Strong
saw him as he opened the door and greeted
him warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ted; it&#8217;s good to see you. We certainly
shall miss you when you go back to
Wayland. But I guess you will be glad to be
back, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly will. I am going by way of
Big Gulch and shall stop off at the ranch for
a day or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a splendid idea, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; commented
Walker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ted, hear anything more from our
friends, the enemy?&#8221; asked Strong, laughingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, but then I would not be the one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
to hear. I thought Mr. Walker would, he
was going to claim his property.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, I must do that; I have completely
forgotten it,&#8221; remarked Walker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ted, they were very nice at Ottawa.
I understand the Government is going
to honor you in some way for your service;
they even spoke of doing the same thing for
both Walker and myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong gave Ted an outline of what had
happened, but made no mention of the letter
from Sir Robert. Walker was tempted to
remind him, thinking that he had forgotten,
but he remembered that Strong had said he
wished to handle that end himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you will be busy packing and
getting ready tomorrow. You leave at four
on Saturday afternoon? Come down and
see us before you go. When we need your
services again, we&#8217;ll have you come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted got up to go. As he opened the door,
Strong called to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Ted, I almost forgot another thing
which probably is not very important. I
have a letter for you; silly, not to have remembered.&#8221;
And Strong smiled, while
Walker laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; said Ted wonderingly, as he
took the letter. Then, as he opened it, he
saw the check. He looked at it a little dazed.
He saw his name as if in a haze&mdash;then he
saw the amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thousand dollars&mdash;and for me?&#8221;
He stammered the words, he was almost
stricken dumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for you&mdash;to do with as you will.
You certainly deserve it,&#8221; said Strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit of it,&#8221; added Walker.</p>
<p>Ted had a feeling as if he wanted to cry.
He did. Walker patted him on the shoulder
understandingly, while Strong looked out of
the window and pretended he did not see.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a letter which you might be glad
to read and which I think will be almost as
welcome as the money.&#8221; Strong turned
round and faced him as he said this.</p>
<p>The boy opened the letter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'>&#8220;August 2, 1914.<br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:left'>&#8220;Master Theodore Marsh,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.0em;'>&#8220;Chicago, Illinois.</span><br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Dear Theodore:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Mr. Strong has advised me as to the
service you have done Canada. It has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
a big service, one that Canada must remember.
I want you to know that it does and
will. You have shown a capacity for thinking,
for doing the right thing at the right
time. I think even better than both these
things, though, has been the simple way in
which you have carried out instructions
when conditions were such as to put up to
you the burden of necessary action. What
would have been a remarkable accomplishment
for a man is a tremendous accomplishment
for a boy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I regret the fact that you are not Canadian
but am glad you are a loyal American.
Your country is fortunate in having a boy of
your kind. I hope you will have the future
that your present action promises.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;The enclosed, in a small way, signalizes
a reward for your invaluable services.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I hope to have the pleasure of meeting
you at some time, and I am,</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.125em;'>&#8220;Very sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'>&#8220;Robert Wingate.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine letter, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Ted,
when he finished. He spoke in a low voice&mdash;he
did not trust his feelings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s fine. Sir Robert is a great man.
He does things in a big way. But I think
you want to go home now, so go.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ted did.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>TED GOES BACK</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;But, Ted, it would be impossible for us
to go on Saturday. I am not so sure
that we can go at all, it will require a lot of
thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marsh had heard the wonderful news
and Ted&#8217;s sudden plan for them to go out to
Big Gulch or Wayland. She was trying to
show Ted how impossible it was for them to
do it and he was only just beginning to
acknowledge that perhaps Saturday would
be too soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I tell you, mother. Maybe Saturday
is too soon, but you will be ready in two
weeks&mdash;that is plenty of time. I know that
Helen will be able to do whatever she wants
to do out there&mdash;and this money, after we
have repaid the Deans, will help to tide over
the time until we are settled. We shall hear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
what Helen says&mdash;and I shall speak to Mr.
and Mrs. Dean when I get out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was told the news almost before she
passed the doorstep. She was astonished
and glad and cried all in the same minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;How wonderful!&#8221; she finally managed
to say.</p>
<p>Then she was told of Ted&#8217;s plan. The boy
had thought that she might need convincing,
but she agreed almost at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I can obtain a position in my line
of work out there. It is a land of opportunity
and we should grasp the chance to get
out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>All that remained was for Ted to get the
opinion of the Deans.</p>
<p>Ted went down to say good-bye to Strong
and Walker the next day. Both men were
very busy, but the three had lunch together
and Ted promised to write to both of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may have to write both of us at the
front&mdash;we shall go off to the war&mdash;that is,
Walker will. It may be my bad luck to have
to stay on duty here, although I have asked
to be relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ted,&#8221; said Walker, &#8220;I shall see
you at the train.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I will try to do so,&#8221; added Strong.</p>
<p>The boy told both his friends of the plan
to bring his mother and sister out West.
They agreed that it was a good plan.</p>
<p>His mother and sister, and Walker and
Strong saw him depart. It was just a year
before that Ted had left, what a big year it
had been.</p>
<p>Ted&#8217;s thoughts turned to the ranch. He
was eager to see Red Mack, Smiles, Graham,
Pop, and the Deans. He hoped it would
be Red who would meet him&mdash;and that he
would bring his horse down so that they
could go back to the ranch on horseback.
Of course, in all likelihood, it would be the
Packard that would come down for him, for
the distance was long and it would mean a
lot of extra trouble for Red or anyone to
lead his horse down all the way. The trip
to Big Gulch seemed long because of the
boy&#8217;s eagerness to see his friends. He
awakened very early on the second morning
when the train was due. When the train
finally reached the station, he eagerly looked
out to see who was there. But he could see
no one until he stepped from the train.</p>
<p>There stood Red and next to him Pop.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
There were three horses and one of them
was his.</p>
<p>Glad greetings were exchanged.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, I&#8217;m glad you came for me on horseback.
I hoped you would, but it seemed too
much to expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we figured you would like it. Glad
you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started off. As best he could, Ted
told his story and both of the men listened
with different interest. When Ted came to
that part where it had practically been
settled that his mother and Helen were
to come out, a queer look came into Pop&#8217;s
eyes which neither of them saw. The older
man rode behind most of the way after that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should see Wolf, you would not
know him,&#8221; said Red.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he would not know me, either,&#8221;
answered Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may be your dog, but I&#8217;m kind of attached
to him myself,&#8221; remarked Red.</p>
<p>Some time in the afternoon they reached
the ranch. Smiles was there and so were
the other men and they gave Ted a great
welcome.</p>
<p>So did Wolf, who had grown wonderfully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
and who, while he did not look like any
particular kind of dog, showed himself to
have an individuality, all his own. He
sprang at Ted and barked his delight. It
made Ted feel good to have the dog remember
him. It was queer to see how the dog
tried to pay attention to both Red and Ted,
and it made the men laugh at his double
devotion.</p>
<p>Ted hurried to the house where Mrs. Dean
was waiting for him. She showed how glad
she was to see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dean will be back a little later. He
has been very busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted thought he would wait with his news
until later and merely mentioned some of
the things that had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Dean, &#8220;I want to
tell you that we are going to have a little
stranger in this house, soon.&#8221; Then Ted
knew why he had hesitated about blurting
out his news&mdash;there was an even bigger
event to happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>He stayed a little while only, as Mrs. Dean
did not seem strong.</p>
<p>He saw Dean when he came home. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
both of his friends he told his news, what
had been done, he showed Sir Robert&#8217;s letter
and then spoke of his plan for his mother
and sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;How wonderful,&#8221; said Mrs. Dean, while
John Dean looked tenderly at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you, Ted. I counted on
you, but you did much more. I heard from
Strong, but I did not know what had been
accomplished. As to your mother and sister&mdash;they
must come out here&mdash;the wonderful
thing is that Mrs. Dean will need your
mother&#8217;s help very soon and it all seems to
fit one thing into another. Helen will get a
rest here; she need not worry as to finding
the right kind of opportunity. When do you
expect to write home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once,&#8221; answered Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner they come the better, although
I suppose it will be every bit of two
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted started to leave his friends to rejoin
Red and the rest. Dean caught up with him
about one hundred yards from the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Ted,&#8221; he started without any
preamble, &#8220;I feel as if my country is calling
me. I cannot think of going until the child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
is born and Mrs. Dean is well. But I shall
have to, hard as it may be. That is one reason
why I shall be glad to have your sister
and your mother here. They will be company
for Mrs. Dean. She agrees with me
that I should go. She is the bravest, best
woman in the world.&#8221; He stopped for a
minute. &#8220;I shall see you later, as soon as
Mrs. Dean takes her rest. I want to know
all about Chicago and what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>He returned to the house while Ted joined
the men.</p>
<p>They were in the midst of a discussion of
the war. Ted listened. Smiles and several
of the other men were leaving in three days&mdash;off
for the war. Red was not going&mdash;he
was American. &#8220;I may go later, if they
need me,&#8221; he said. There was to be a great
shortage of men at the ranch.</p>
<p>Dean had made Pop the new foreman to
take Smiles&#8217; place. Pop was not in the
conversation, he was sitting by himself and
he showed every desire to be left alone.
After a little while, he left the room.</p>
<p>It made the war very near and Ted felt
very lonely to hear that these friends of his
were going off, some of them never to return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE MARSHES REUNITED</h3>
</div>
<p>Pop entered the house. He wanted advice
and he wanted it bad. He knew
that ordinarily he would have gone to Mrs.
Dean&mdash;a woman would help so much at a
time like this. But Dean met him in the
hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Pop&mdash;what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; asked
Dean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jack. I can&#8217;t say whether it&#8217;s
trouble or not. What I want is advice.
Maybe you can give it to me, although I
figured Mrs. Dean would be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, I may be able to help.&#8221; Dean
was surprised at the agitation of the older
man.</p>
<p>Pop told his story. He did not keep any
of the details from Dean. The latter listened,
his astonishment growing all the
time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Jack, it&#8217;s this way. If they
come here, my wife will see me. She probably
hates me. I cannot hope that she will
understand. On the other hand, I want so
much to be with her, I am going to be foreman
and that means I can support her comfortably.
But I probably would make her
miserable if I entered into her life again.
What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us ask Mrs. Dean. She will give
you the right answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean listened. There was no hesitation
in her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to Chicago at once. You need not
worry about how your wife will take it, nor
as to how she feels. I know. She understands
better than you can ever suppose.
Jack, dear, whoever said that God did not
weave our lives? How closely our friends
here have been interwoven with our lives,
how much we have been of service to each
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to Chicago on the first train,&#8221; she
finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we shall tell Ted. Bring them
back with you,&#8221; added Dean.</p>
<p>Pop left the house, much relieved. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
was happy that his duty was what his inclination
was&mdash;what he craved to do. He
joined the other men.</p>
<p>Without giving any explanation he told
Smiles he would have to be away for about
ten days and that he had already arranged
for the same with John Dean.</p>
<p>Early the next morning he was off. He
asked Red to take him down. To Red he
explained the whole thing, that he was coming
back with his folks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand a whole lot of things now.
How queerly you acted at times. I guess
I&#8217;ll call you Marsh, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s up to you to explain. I
shall wire you before you do so. If my wife
should decide that she does not want me, I
am not coming back. If she decides she will
forgive me, I will telegraph you and you can
let it out casually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be glad to do so,&#8221; answered Red.
&#8220;Is Jack going to tell Ted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy will be glad. He likes you a lot.
But, mostly glad, because it will make his
mother happy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so much that it will,&#8221; the older
man answered.</p>
<p>We are not going into details as to the
meeting between the Marshes. We, who are
acquainted with so much of their story, can
imagine what happened. Bill Marsh left
home because he felt he could not hold his
head up nor his wife&#8217;s respect. He had
been very foolish, and it was this foolishness,
this false pride, even a lack of faith in
the understanding of his wife that had made
him stay away. Who should have known
him better than his own wife? It was harder
to make Helen understand. She asked some
searching questions, but in the end she realized
the fine manliness of her father.</p>
<p>The two, mother and daughter, marveled
at the coincidence of the father being at the
same place as Ted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is a small place, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said Mrs. Marsh.</p>
<p>It did not take very long for them to be
ready to leave. Marsh helped where he
could and a week after he arrived they left
for Big Gulch. Red had paved the way, in
accordance with their plan.</p>
<p>Ted was too surprised to make any comment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
when he heard the news. At first he
was furiously angry at his father. Boylike,
he could not forgive certain things which an
older person could. It was Mrs. Dean, even
more than Red and John Dean, who made
him see and understand.</p>
<p>Then the Marshes came to Big Gulch.
Matters adjusted themselves. It was a busy
time for all. Smiles was off, smiling and
glad. So were the other men who were to
go. Brave men, all of them, doing their duty
as they saw it. Pop took up his duties as
foreman.</p>
<p>Then the child was born to the Deans. A
girl, which seemed like a squalling, ugly
baby, much like any other baby, to Ted. But
to say so to the mother or to the father or to
Mrs. Marsh or to Helen, would have been a
great, an awful insult.</p>
<p>The men came in to see the heir apparent.
They seemed clumsy, uncouth, sheepish
creatures and all of them were glad to get
away, including Pop and Ted.</p>
<p>With the excitement subsiding, things
began again to take a normal aspect. Mrs.
Dean began to sit up, the child began to
look more like a human being, it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
been decided that Helen was to rest for a
few months and then continue her studies
at the nearest preparatory school, with the
purpose of entering college. John Dean was
to leave for the front in two weeks.</p>
<p>Our story is almost complete. Ted received
a great welcome at the Academy.
The boys had heard of what he had done, of
his reward and the letter he had received
from Sir Robert Wingate. For one whole
day his coming made the Great War an even
smaller event. Captain Wilson had gone to
Ottawa, he had been promoted to be a major.
Some of the instructors were gone and even
one or two of the older students. Those who
were left spoke only of the time when they,
too, could go and they were bemoaning their
misfortune in being young.</p>
<p>Ted heard from the folks at home. He
heard from Helen and somehow he got the
impression that all she spoke about was
Red and what a fine man he was. A letter
from Red made no mention of Helen, but
he did say that he was getting down to the
serious business of thinking of the future.
Even as young as Ted was, he could guess
that they had become great friends and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
was glad. His father wrote him that he had
placed his $1,000.00 in the bank for him, he
having settled all the debts and accounts
himself. It was a fine letter and it removed
what resentment still remained with Ted
against his father. His mother also wrote,
saying she was wonderfully happy and he
got a short note from John Dean before he
left. He also heard from Walker, who told
him he was off for the war, but that Strong
had to stay.</p>
<p>Syd Graham and Ted were inseparable.
They did many things together and the
plans for the future each of the boys made
included the other. There was, of course, a
great deal more of military training and
many times the boys at the Academy were
called upon for some duty or other.</p>
<p>So the days went. Ted received a fall vacation
and he went home. There was news
from the front. Dean had been wounded, so
the report came, not seriously, but enough
to disable him, and he was returning home.
He would always limp. In that awful charge
when so many Canadians had been wounded
and killed, Smiles had lost his life. It made
Ted very sad to think that he would never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
see the happy, smiling ex-foreman again.
Helen was at school. Ted pumped Red
Mack as to Helen and found his suspicions
confirmed. He teased Red unmercifully
and it was one time when Red was flustered.
The Dean baby was a healthy, lusty youngster
of a few months.</p>
<p>Ted Marsh has his life before him. This
story is but one incident of his early life.
But for later events we must look elsewhere.</p>
